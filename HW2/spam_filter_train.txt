ham	Subject king ranch there are two fields of gas that i am having difficulty with in the unify system 1 cage ranch since there is no processing agreement that accomodates this gas on king ranch it is my understanding hpl is selling the liquids and king ranch is re delivering to stratton it is also my understanding that there is a 05 cent fee to deliver this gas we need a method to accomodate the volume flow on hpl at meter 415 and 9643 this gas will not be reflected on trans usage ticket 123395 and 95394 since it is not being nominated from a processing agreement we either need to input a point nom on hpl or krgp at these meters to match the nom at meter 9610 or a deal for purchase and sale if king ranch is taking title to the gas needs to be input into sitara at these meters with the appropriate rate i have currently input a point nom on krgp to accomodate this flow so we can divert some of this gas to the current interstate sales that are being made 2 forest oil there is a processing agreement that will accomodate flow from the meter 6396 into king ranch it is my understanding that this agreement was originally setup until texaco had their own processing agreement i need confirmation that the gas from this meter should be nominated on contract 96006681 and that this agreement should have been reassigned to hplc it is currently still under hplr if this gas is not nominated on the above transport agreement then once again we need to accomodate the flow volume on the hpl pipe with either a point nom or a sitara deal at meters 415 and 9643

ham	Subject marketing services scheduling daren thinking about robert s little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling the marketing sitara function back to your side of the fence i think a strong case could be made in favor of that idea it is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets pathing nominating and confirming the industrials this dissipates the knowledge base and the responsibility factor it is a who s on first issue if the responsibility to ensure pricing volume and accomplishment of market intent is accurately depicted and in sitara is in your shop then the schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of unify and pops i m sure this would help volume management and client services immensely as the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and more of the marketing function sitara to the scheduling group in the hopes they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture i believe the current situation is too much too fast for scheduling to handle all at once it has also created a situation where robert seems to think not only that he has all the segments mastered but that he is the only person that should be involved in the industrials i will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue but if you and pat leave things the way they are please explain to both robert and pat that others may be involved in the industrial activity and that is quite alright once again thanks for listening ken attl htm

the new j v between enron texaco which will be combining the lrc and bridgeline pipeline systems summary the lrc bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the name of bridgeline llc ownership in the jv will be split 60 texaco 40 enron bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be trading on the pipelines under the new j v contracts and service agreements are in the process of being drafted enron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems to support this j v texaco will be providing the scada system i understand that accounting is still being discussed the trading risk perhaps scheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the 21 st floor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the 3 allen center once a more permanent spot can be built out trading for the new jv will start in early february for march production to do s accounting i ve asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture it transition and ongoing costs texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next monday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same page and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks pc s jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pc s for this jv at my request i will need the work order numbers to track these costs networks i m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the voice and data networks are in place for eb 21 once the more permanent spot is nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location a combination of trader phones lucent phones stenfons and amtels have been requested location on eb 21 i m waiting on a call back from chris larson from facilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall cubes there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall cubes we can t set up the pc s phones amtels etc until this is done data conversion i have requested from texaco the contract deal and meter facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin trading for march production it may be possible to get an electronic dump of this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need we also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios i will also need to know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the system security i have received the names of the traders but i don t know who else will need access interface between enron s unify pop s application and bridgeline s scada application i ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright from texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two applications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface there will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc s rtu s efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system in the meantime there will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everything is merged into one this will probably mean some manual interfaces between pop s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is complete scada communications currently the lrc rtu s efm communicate back to enron s scada system via leased lines bridgelines rtu s communicate back to them via a microwave system the new jv could save on communications costs by switching lrc s rtu communication to the microwave perhaps this is best done as a part of the scada transition accounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes this data needs to be better defined i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get this process started hourly volumes bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be billed on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing we need to talk through this process to see what enhancements may be needed at least initially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the billing for this one customer please let me know if you d like to meet on any of these topics i can have my assistant set up the meeting if needed in the mean time i can be reached at 713 853 6858 thanks tommy

ham	Subject some after thoughts to our meeting hi daren i enjoyed our lunch together yesterday and believe we made a good beginning you have very high standards for your own performance and are highly committed to the best outcome in all situations you are likely to have high expectations for results from our coaching meetings this a good formula for success and i will do my best to honor your strengths with a focus on moving the action forward with this in mind i had some thoughts and additional questions for reflection following the meeting that i would like to share you are in a transition from being a high team performer to becoming the leader of a high performing team one of your frustrations as leader is that members of your team seem to rely too much on you to solve problems that arise in the day to day operations of the team at first you responded to their requests for help by solving it for them then you shifted to using questioning techniques to have them solve the problem with you you have also offered some training to address the learnings needed to be more independent problem solvers you are frustrated when some members of the team continue to come to you with questions they should be able to solve and when they fail to implement changes that you have trained them to use you are seeking ways for the the team to have the same problem solving ability that they come to you for you have recruited people with this ability and you seek to expand it in the team this issue was the focus of our first session and needs to be the focus our next meeting the question is how to engage the team in solving this problem how do i get the members of this team to own this responsibility and begin creating their own solutions what resources are needed by each person to contribute more to this problem how do i involve the team members more in the solving of this problem what new behaviors do i need to employ to increase the involvement of the team what do i need to change in myself or my relationship to the people in order to engage them more actively in the problem there is one dimension that i am clear about i know that you have used performance appraisals to give feedback have you put this issue before the team as a whole for the team to solve or have you tried to change individual team members i look forward to our meeting on the 17 th keep growing mike teamleadership center mobile 713 598 6732 office 713 871 8326 fax 713 871 1707 home 409 321 0680 mam teamlead com

ham	Subject re sale to shoreline daren you are correct in that this was only in mops for the 26 th it was edi d over to pops from the 25 th through the 31 st populating all days with the 16 700 nom the nom was never 0 out in pops therefore the change notification process in pops did not pick up a change at this meter this meter is pathed by kim and confirmed by me it is extremely odd that this was missed in mops the record would have been out of balance and someone if not several people normally would make a comment on this also all of my records indicate that the 16 700 was good through the 31 st except the mops entry my confirmations with koch didn t reflect the 0 the last report i have from koch indicated the 16 700 stayed on there was no record of a phone call indicating anything other than 16 700 it is very odd for this many checks and balances to fail also the volumes were being sent back to mops which no one caught i have spoken with koch today and they agree that the 16 700 should have gone to 0 therefore i have removed the nom from pops confirmed volumes and re allocated the meter the oba has taken the hit and i am working off the imbalance now daren i am sorry that you had to look into this when you feel this is my responsibility stella was trying to help me out in clearing up errors because i was buried in current activity thus the e mail to you asking for your help if this doesn t answer all the questions just give me a call thanks charlotte daren j farmer 02 14 2000 12 50 pm to stella l morris hou ect ect charlotte hawkins hou ect ect cc pat clynes corp enron enron subject re sale to shoreline stella and charlotte i looked into this deal we sold this gas for one day only in mops the path was nominated for 1 26 only however in pops the path was nominated and confirmed for 1 26 1 31 this should have been showing up as a bridgeback error during the month also someone should have identified that the path nom in mops wasn t the same as the nom in pops this discrepancy should have been found before we closed out january i researched this problem by reviewing both systems looking at the path id in pops finding it in mops and checking the audit on the path in mops this type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group who has all the necessary tools to find the problem the resolution not the problem should have been presented to myself or the marketer with an explanation of what happened some one still needs to find out how the gas was confirmed for the 27 th 31 st since the gas apparently flowed we will have to apply the overflow to the oba unless you can find a missing transport contract d from stella l morris 02 10 2000 02 26 pm to daren j farmer hou ect ect cc charlotte hawkins hou ect ect subject sale to shoreline fyi forwarded by stella l morris hou ect on 02 10 2000 02 25 pm from sherlyn schumack 02 10 2000 02 21 pm to joanie h ngo hou ect ect katherine herrera corp enron enron cc stella l morris hou ect ect subject sale to shoreline joanie logistics is waiting to hear from daren on this issue he will either need to extend the deal or maybe there should be another deal in place this deal 155118 is valid on 1 26 00 only but the rest of the volume you are looking for is scheduled on days 1 27 1 31 i am sure there is no pricing on those days i will let you know as soon as i hear from them

ham	Subject the expatriate zone issue 1 2 14 00 the expatriate zone 1 15 00 issue 1 where every day is just another shitty day in paradise the zine for the tropically impaired in this issue featured expatriate of the month james sunny jim white travel into the zone and beat the irs at the same time jimmydotcom where s that parrot head book we ve been hearing about club trini update millennium change bubba style see what all the hullabaloo online was about cabo 1999 bad boys of the expatriated phan club spotted south of the border parrothead pilots association new club in the making for the web page edition go to it includes some great pictures we suggest printing it out and laying it out on your coffee table that way you have somewhere to set your red stripe so you don t leave rings on the table welcome to the expatriate zone welcome to the first issue of the expatriate zone the official newsletter of the new expatriate zone web site after publishing the temperate zone for the past two years i m taking the opportunity to join forces with bob segel who has been publishing the coconut modem with karen coyne since april of 1994 last year after operating in aol exclusively bob created parrotkey com out on the internet where it would join it s sister site on aol and be accessible to all parrot heads at the time bob expanded pk we had been working on my little area of club st somewhere and the new parrotkey com seemed like the perfect place to open the doors of the club while we were talking about the direction we wanted to see club st somewhere and parrot key go we could see that this was the perfect chance to as emeril says kick it up a notch jimmy buffett s music was a big part of our lives but even more so was the expatriate lifestyle he sang about a lifestyle that includes tropical travel sailing boating parasailing and surfing and yes the music and lyrics of mr james w buffett so it is that we created our new web site the expatriate zone along with this newsletter of that same name in december the expatriate zone opened its doors with its island trading post with its holiday shopping service at the island trading post over 3 600 people visited the site the first day and daily prizes were awarded for the first two weeks the island trading post will open again soon offering a complete line of tropical items not just to those of us that live a few blocks from wal mart but also for those of us lucky enough to be on a sailboat or living on an island for not we ll start with the t shirt of the month we want the expatriate zone to not only keep you entertained and informed while you toil away at your everyday corporate gig but it will also get you ready for that day you finally shuck it all and disappear down into the expatriate zone we hope you all enjoy our new effort and also continue to visit parrot key and club st somewhere both of which will be closely associated with the expatriate zone and parrotkey com jackson bob expatriate of the month james sunny jim white when i first ventured on the internet in 1995 i ran in to a guy named sunny jim who was living down in the cayman islands we never really got a chance to connect for which i am truly sorry but when something is supposed to happen it usually does on the first leg of my road dawg tour click on road dawg i stayed with my good friend alex janet leist and their wonderful children over the five days i stayed at their house alex and i listened to a lot of music and one of the guys we both liked was sunny jim i bought one of james cds from alex and fell in love with it immediately the cd was his second called life in the laid back lane little did i know that i would meet up with james and his roady shady floyd several times over the next six months james was embarking on his first real tour of the us since he moved down island almost twelve years ago we got several chances to talk over the summer and we will have an in depth article about this expatriate soon on the expatriate zone web site be sure to watch for it in the meantime here are a couple of quick things i learned about this great musician when i asked him about his expatriate status his reply was technically an expatriate is someone who lives outside their own country for whatever reason for some it s legal reasons others just because they want to or that s where the work is i have been an expatriate for nearly twelve years now i have pretty fully lived the whole caribbean experience from climbing the coconut trees and spear fishing to sailing scuba diving hot afternoons on the beach and romantic moonlit nights under the swaying palms even as james is about to repatriate himself and his family i ask if there were any other places he would consider living as an expatriate maybe somewhere on the coast of mexico or in a group of islands that are all within sailing distance of one another was the advice he gave until we can learn more of sunny jim s world stop by his web site at and if you don t have one of his cds including his latest release sandbar serenade for goodness sake pick one up you can also read a great interview alex conducted with james at travel into the zone some are running from the irs we strongly believe that we all have to get away from our computer screens and out into the real world as often as we can does this mean we give up one our most useful tools of communication computers heck no with laptops cell phones and gps systems we can go anywhere and still stay in touch if we feel the need but get real and throw that pager away as soon as you can we hope to keep this section current and informative hopefully hearing from those of you already living your lives in the zone helping the rest of us prepare for our getaway from the cities i m sure there are some of us that are preparing to disappear to places like costa rica where the the expatriate zone will become an important tool how would you like to check out a place to disappear to and write it off your taxes at the same time want to go down into the zone to places like the bahamas belize st croix puerto rico bonaire the dominica republic or saba want to do something for the planet work with dolphins save a coral reef or study monkeys and the rain forest at the same time well we have the answer check out these organization s web sites and then get some advice from your financial advisor on 501 c non profit organizations depending on the tax bracket you re in uncle sam could end up paying for up to half the trip the oceanic society earthwatch institute reef the reef environmental education foundation after that all that s left is to make that plane reservation and remember no plane on sunday jimmydotcom after many delays jimmydotcom has finally gone to the printer with a due date of the middle of april i hit some bumps in the road on my way to publishing the first ever book about the parrot head phenomena but it was all worth it this book isn t about jimmy buffett it s about the effect of the internet on parrot heads for more information visit we have a complete outline of the book reviews from other parrot heads and samples of the pages on the site financial considerations have limited the first printing to 1 000 copies at the present time so if your even thinking of buying a book i suggest you reserve your copy by putting your name on the reservation list you will be under no financial obligation it will simply indicate to my financial partners who aren t parrot heads just how many books we need to print do it right away because pre sales were brisk and if enough of you reserve a copy i can get the financing to expand the first printing let s show the world what parrot heads stand for by making this book a big success when i was on the bhotm tour this summer i had many people tell me they wanted to buy an extra book to give to their boss they wanted the boss to understand why getting the day off for a buffett concert is so important maybe it will help the rest of us to explain ourselves to our friends that just don t get it here s one of the latest reviews of the book from bob robinson founder president of the sandlapper phc in south carolina i had a great time with this club on the road dawg tour and shared an advance copy with his club when we received jackson s plea for pictures our members were blown away we hustled up a package of pix as did a majority of the parrot head clubs from around the globe and the result is pure parrothedonistic pleasure this collection is bound for glory in the annals of island time if moderation is your key to life then stay away from jimmydotcom cause this book is packed with those stories only we can tell congratulations bubbafreak bobrob sandlapper phc club trini update speaking of expatriates how about the guys who play the true music of the zone club trini s long awaited live cd will finally be coming out this april one year after it s recording jimmy has been keeping mike and robert pretty busy so it s understandable that it took awhile it will be the third in the margaritaville cafe late nite series i can t wait to hear it as my wife and i were some of the lucky ones who were in new orleans when it was recorded you can get a look at all the songs included on the new cd at club trini s revamped web site at along with the great songs we ve become accustomed to are a few i m pretty excited about if you haven t heard ct s version of african friend you re in for a real treat along with that is a song that tina and nadirah have been treating audiences to this past summer cario and bob marley s no woman no cry at the new web site fans can now order their favorite club trini cds using their credit cards so there s no excuse to not owning everything available i think a true expatriate musical library is incomplete without club trini this summer helen hiatt jimmy and the coral reefer s wardrobe designer came up with a shirt that club trini members lovingly call the ice cream vendor shirt which they wear out front at the start of the concert ok pete sometimes forgets his and when he does have it on it lost it s sleeves somewhere along the way there s a great design that has been applied to a t shirt that we all can own check it out at their site jesters and friends note card series tro pics has just released their first note cards series from their jesters and friends original oils friends places and musicians from past years have inspired these cards and parrot heads and expatriates alike will want to have these great looking cards for those times when an email just isn t personal enough the original artwork is also on sale at this site so be sure to stop by and visit them included in the jesters series are our good friends tim glancey and wally nickel millennium change bubba style i ve got to tell you i wasn t buying into this new millennium thing one bit in fact i had almost decided not to go to the buffett new year s eve show nothing to do with jimmy but i just didn t get the whole hype but at the last minute i had a change of heart and now after being a special guest at seagram s party honoring the new margaritaville tequila i m sure glad i went the shows kind of melded together for me making the millennium change over very special if you want to hear more about this or see some

previous trips down to cobo san lucas mexico i had to miss this year s trek due to my being with the beach house on the moon tour on it s florida new orleans and houston swing as the story goes those bad boys and girls from the expatriated phan club showed up again mainly for the t shirts that said too much tequila or not quite enough on the back who are those people anyway whenever i go to their

too i hate seeing jimmy in vegas but i ve got to keep the streak alive and seeing all my parrot head friends will make it all worthwhile i hope peter mayer ends up playing there again this year and speaking of those great t shirts we have some neat shirts available at the island store they re similar to the shirt you got if you went on this year s trip except they have tropo travel s seaplane on the back and the no bad days logo on the front breast you can see a picture at parrothead pilots association here are a couple of tidbits for your airplane nuts and pilots out there a new online

ham	Subject bpa rate case seasonal rates forwarded by mary hain hou ect on 03 14 2000 08 48 am enron capital minnesota power and light co opinion no 12 issued april 14 1978 mimeo at 24 5 65 229 in both cases the commission rejected rate design features where there was no evidence in the record showing that the rate design features reflected cost incurrence id in its order setting this proceeding for hearing the commission took note of edison s proposed seasonal differential and specifically directed that the parties fully address the issues related to the cost support for the seasonal rate design commission order issued march 30 1979 mimeo at 4 5 on october 9 1980 the parties were directed by the presiding judge to identify in their initial briefs the portions of the record that relate to cost support for the seasonal differential the requirement that edison provide cost support for its seasonal differential as discussed supra is also set forth in the commission s filing requirements for rate schedules if the rate design is intended to reflect costs the applicant must show how it reflects costs if the rate design is not intended to reflect costs the applicant must justify the departure from costbased rates 18 cfr o 35 13 b 4 iii statement p edison s seasonal differential is intended to lessen the costs imposed upon it by its prominent summer peak edison reasons that since it must build capacity to meet its prominent summer peak charging more in the summer would give customers an incentive to control their summer demands and therefore edison s cost of adding capacity would be reduced tr 169 accordingly edison must show how its seasonal differential reflects the costs imposed on it by summer demand under the commission s filing requirements in 18 cfr o 35 13 b 4 iii statement p further even purpa section 111 d 4 relied upon by edison states that rates shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility emphasis added further support for relying on marginal rather than average costs comes from the commission itself in its order of march 30 1979 setting this cause for hearing mimeo at 4 5 the commission in commenting on time of day and seasonal rates mentioned that it encourage innovative rate design to match more closely rates to costs in this regard the commission cited its order no 537 supra at 4 which specifically suggests use of pricing mechanisms based on marginal cost principles 65 236 for jurisdictional wholesale sales under the circumstances in this case where the sale of economy energy is related to edison s costs in adding or eliminating additional excess capacity it is appropriate to establish the price for economy transactions on marginal costs this provides a more close matching of the rate to the cost than would a rate design based on average costs accordingly winnetka s position on pricing of economy energy will not be adopted affirmed and reversed see next paragraph comm opinion order 23 ferc 61 219 commonwealth edison company docket nos er 79 182 000 and er 80 106 000 may 12 1983 turning to commonwealth s exceptions we find that the judge correctly rejected the seasonal differential even if we accept the company s interpretation of purpa it still has not cited any record evidence whatsoever of a difference in costs between summer and nonsummer months without at least some showing of a cost difference it is impossible to make a judgment on the reasonableness of the company s 15 25 proposal we therefore uphold the judge on this point we reverse the judge s adoption of a price set at 110 of the utility s incremental costs however and approve the type b split savings method proposed by commonwealth under this method economy transactions are arranged for a 12 hour or similar period at a fixed price based on cost estimates at the time of the agreement if the utility s incremental costs rise to the point that continued supply would become burdensome the utility may terminate supply we find this method superior to that proposed by staff in that implementation is greatly simplified cost determinations need not be made as frequently related to pmas reg preamble fercsr 36 710 procedures for public participation in power and transmission rate adjustments and extensions december 31 1980 10 cfr 903 45 fr 86976 36 741 historically many purpa type standards have been used in designing wholesale rates for the sale of federal hydroelectric power pmas analyze costs to establish revenue requirements and consider this information in designing rates declining block rates for energy were once used by the pmas but subsequently were found inappropriate and eliminated from rate schedules many of the pmas for years have been effectively using various forms of load management measures in their rate schedules such as scheduling limitations loadshaping capacity and energy overrun charges etc bpa has had a history of using seasonal rates for wholesale firm capacity and energy and also offered its direct service industrial customers interruptible rates some time ago southwestern has had interruptible capacity rates in effect since 1957 these examples demonstrate the willingness of the pmas to implement purpa type standards where applicable many of these purpa type standards when applied appropriately in the design of pma rates can serve to implement the purposes of purpa by encouraging conservation of energy efficient use of resources and facilities and equitable rates the public participation process will provide an opportunity to examine these and other appropriate concepts the pmas will continue to review and revise their power marketing practices on a system by system basis to serve the purpa objectives the assistant secretary for resource applications working with the administrators of the power administrations

qualifying facilities and inter connection facilities march 16 1988 docket no rm 88 6 000 53 fr 9331 55 fr 31882 pricing flexibility may take several different forms for instance a contract could provide qfs with a price floor applicable to all the power supplied to the utility but still provide for higher variable unit prices reflecting daily or seasonal periods the price floor would provide the revenue stream necessary for the qf to secure financial support while 32 174 the price variability would induce the qf to maximize deliveries in peak load periods when the utility values additional supplies most of course the price floor should not exceed the minimum value of the utility s avoided cost similarly a contract could provide for a two part price a fixed payment for capacity and an energy price for power delivered the qf would be assured a minimum revenue stream based on the value of its capacity the variable energy component would allow the utility to dispatch the qf capacity only when it was economic whatever the pattern of contract payments rates for purchases from qfs should always reflect how well the characteristics of the suppliers power match the purchasing utility s need this will ensure that the qf will make most production decisions on the basis of rates reflecting avoided costs rather than the guaranteed average rate and at the same time will receive revenues sufficient to attract investors to avoid problems such as those associated with take or pay contracts in the natural gas industry the commission wishes to stress the danger of including forecasted fuel costs in the fixed rate structure of long term contracts especially in combination with the specification of minimum purchase quantities the commission also encourages the use of time of day and seasonal rates in flexible pricing structures for long term contracts reg preamble fercsr 1977 1981 30 128 small power production and cogeneration facilities regulations

following will give more clarification let me know if you have any questions or need more detail thanks dg 3 9517 sitara unify process scenario counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had been pathed scheduled bridged back from unify impact zero impact to logistics volume management absolutely harmless settlements has process in place to eliminate issues process counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline the new name ctprty b does bridge over to unify ctprty a remains at the path level in unify gui display does not change ctprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify the field is now highlighted to indicate a change occurred gui display changes only at high level not on path the scheduler has choice to repath if necessary or not re path if re pathing occurs the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path unify pushes back the deal number meter to sitara not ctprty info balancing works on deal number meter only not ctprty info the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara where all information is correct volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie out all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectly settlements utilizes information in unify settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts which would create two notification entries if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty re draft would occur note there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now autonoms tom s words of warning previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated basically it would change a key on an edi path duns number not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline if the scheduler re nominated data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct the problem in most cases the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume this is not an issue with unify as explained above dave feel free to chime in if i

provide a general business assessment of your team hr challenges should be identified along with needed skill sets gap analysis and succession planning the template below should be used for the format i am not interested in discussing the business goals but you probably need to think through these in order to discuss the assessments that we will want to discuss as a group review and discussion of exempt employees each will be categorized into the six descriptors used in the feedback process i am expecting each of you to have a listing of accomplishments from your employees along with factual feedback and observations which will allow you to place your employees into appropriate categories i would like to stress that the data to sustantiate the performance descriptor should be factual and documented the focus of employee discussions must be on each employee s individual contribution towards accomplishing our business goals we must safeguard our discussions from he said she said periferal distractors and focus on the work product promotion candidates discussion once again the prc process is a valued process at enron each of you have been through it so you understand the importance of confidentiality additionally the committee will be required to reach an unanimous vote please come to the meeting with your enron hat on not your individual group hat our people are critical to our business therefore it is important for us to be honest when evaluating our staff we must identify our stengths and weaknesses and work towards strengthening our people to ensure the very best business service we can provide what this means is that we should provide our employees with the very best constructive feedback possible in some cases you may be providing a tough message but it is our responsibility and obligation to ensure that each employee fully understands expectations where they are on point and where they are not on point of meeting these expectations so that they can have the next six months to build needed skill sets and or correct behaviors this is your obligation as their immediate supervisor if you have any questions concerns or issues you would like

ham	Subject re fuel application of the fuel retained from transportation and treating contracts doesn t have to be done by zone or compressor in fact i am sure there will be times when we are either short or long compressor fuel when compared to the pipelines total usage usually short i just do not think the market will let me lay off all of this risk it would be really nice if we could get the system to track compressor fuel used to service specific contracts but i am afraid it will always be a facility planning issue fuel should not cause imbalances on the transportation contract a pipeline could be long fuel due to not running compression and in that case we would have to inject or hold in linepack the excess it seems that we would look at fuel on a total basis michael eiben 06 22 2000 01 09 pm to brenda f herod hou ect ect cc lisa csikos hou ect ect daren j farmer hou ect ect mary m smith hou ect ect rita wynne hou ect ect steve venturatos hou ect ect pat clynes corp enron enron edward d gottlob hou ect ect subject re fuel we need to discuss further my concern would be that how do we know what hpl should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our fuel cost also could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance i think that pipeline operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel retainage but if we retain fuel on ena transports then we need to come up with a plan to nominate this in marketing operations to houston pipeline currently this process is not in place enron north america corp from brenda f herod 06 22 2000 12 35 pm to lisa csikos hou ect ect daren j farmer hou ect ect mary m smith hou ect ect rita wynne hou ect ect steve venturatos hou ect ect pat clynes corp enron enron michael eiben hou ect ect cc edward d gottlob hou ect ect subject re fuel what is the answer can the systems and processes handle this please let me know asap thanks edward d gottlob 06 22 2000 10 57 am to bherod enron com cc subject fuel brenda as you know fuel is a big risk one of the things we are trying to do is get the shipper to pay fuel this would mean we would purchase transport and possibly sell gas with a fuel percentage as part of the price can the downstream systems scheduling etc handle this

new gas supply corridor along the gulf coast our recent efforts to provide services such as business operations measurement trading marketing and accounting services to third party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity it is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related

ham	Subject new version of stack manager introduction in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide we have upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your products this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade summary of new features multiple children a child product can be the parent of another child multiple links in a chain and different types of links can be placed against a single parent static product bar prices when you change a price in the product bar and hit the or button the price stays it does not reset to the amount in product properties until you logout sorting you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on the title of the field for multiple sorts hold down your shift key parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified e g the product bar might before have said basis link parent and now would say stand alone parent detailed feature descriptions multiple children the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together in a long chain for example child product a can be linked to parent product b which is in turn linked to parent product c warning although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain system performance is degraded by large chains this is because when a customer attempts a transaction the database must lock each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request the database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks vertical chains multiple parents and children in one long link are much slower to process than flat chains one parent with many children large vertical chains should be avoided related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent for example child product a can have a basis link to parent product b at the same time child product c can have a syncopated basis link to the same parent product b parent b is the parent for both a syncopated basis link and a regular basis link static product bar prices the new version of enrononline provides for sticky product bar price and volume changes when you change a number on the product bar it does not reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you have logged out this makes it easier to update prices volumes spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the or buttons one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements with the old version of stack manager if the price delta was too small traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth this makes it harder for customers to transact with us each time they try a new price update moves the price resulting in an increased transaction failure rate entering an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer but larger price movements are necessary improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices a new field for offset to last trade this allows you to update the offset for products which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu sorting selecting the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old you can now choose any field heading type location reference period etc and sort by that item you can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key example if you select type and then location while holding the shift key you will see your products sorted first by product type and then within each product type by location in alphabetical order if you right click on the product menu you can choose from the same sort criteria plus you can select sort by web order which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website note however that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing when you select products you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always but now you can also hold down the key while making your selections this allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another parent products and f x products one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed the old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the product bar to the left of the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs the new version does not show the type of link this is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product some traders may notice that their products which have f x links are now identified with a stylised fx in the product list this is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the parent rather than managed individually assistance as always if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality please contact the 24 hour help desk houston 713 853 4357 london 44 0 20 7783 7783 australia 61 2 9229 2300 general feedback if you have any comments on the new functionality or suggestions for further functionality please call david forster on 713 853 1861 if you had previously suggested new functionality which didn t make it into this release rest assured that you have not been forgotten we are working hard to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your requests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager

ham	Subject neon september 13 hey guys and girls here s an idea for an icebreaker activity for our 2 nd week of neon this is only an idea you can use it or do something totally different again let me know along the way if you have something that has worked well for your group so we can share in the wealth someone in your group should have a couple of classic books full of icebreaker game type of activities building community in youth groups and youth group trust builders we all at one time had a selection of icebreakers in a gray binder that you might still have somewhere in a drawer spend time in the games and forced interactions especially over the beginning of the semester if you don t have these resources let me know even if some of these ideas may seem familiar to you remember that you may have been doing this far longer than the oldest kids have been in your group but again if you have any ideas for resources let me know in addition to the ideas to think about at the top of the 2 nd weeks topic a couple of additional thoughts given me by leaders realize and possibly communicate in a low key manner to the freshman that their expectations of neon may not initially be met they may be coming in with ideas of what neon is only to possibly be disappointed in a sense it is similar to going to a restaurant or movie after tons of people have recommended it to you and being a little let down more importantly they need to realize that neon is not an event it is a process the teens who say they love it are most often the ones who have been in it long enough to have built relationships and to have shared a bunch of common experiences with time and a commitment on their part to be at neon weekly their expectations will ultimately be met remember that the best quality time you have with the kids is probably before or after neon or at other non neon times have fun loving on your kids wednesday bobby neon opening lesson doc

ham	Subject re big cowboy for august mary is the issue below confirmed volumes versus actual flow the large variance between confirmed and actuals began in june 2000 where 30 mmbtu was scheduled for dix ranch and zero for the big cowboy and big cowboy 2 wells it appears that the volumes for these wells were scheduled at despain where 985 350 mmbtu was confirmed this well has never flowed this much volume and in june 2000 it flowed approximately 320 000 mmbtu do we actually have support i e we talked with someone or have a nom sheet for the 985 350 mmbtu that was entered into mops as confirmed this trend of nothing being confirmed at these three wells continued until july 2000 in august 2000 this scenario changed and 612 388 was confirmed at dix ranch and nothing was scheduled at the big cowboy and big cowboy 2 wells from reading your memo below it also appears that more volume is flowing at these wells that we expected if the issue is an actual increase in the volumes flowing at these wells i would suggest that you call our gas measurement department and ask them to audit coral s charts coral may be is calculating the volumes incorrectly this could also be an allocations issue the allocation as it is in the system today closely agrees with the allocation statement that i receive monthly from karen lambert at tejas the only differences between the tejas schedule and what is in mops are the acock production and gain or loss which are not scheduled and therefore not allocated i know that you are working on the acock production and tom acton and i are working on the gain loss tom will tell me how to path the gas so that i can set up accounting arrangements for april 1999 forward scheduling will have analyze and possibly rework january through march 1999 because these months were originally set up in pops i want to help so if i have missed the issue s would you please clarify it or them for me and let me know if i need to do anything for you thanks fred tom acton enron 09 28 2000 08 10 am to fred boas hou ect ect cc subject big cowboy for august forwarded by tom acton corp enron on 09 28 2000 08 09 am mary poorman 09 27 2000 03 56 pm to daren j farmer hou ect ect tom acton corp enron enron cc clem cernosek hou ect ect howard b camp hou ect ect subject big cowboy for august daren tom beginning with august production i noticed that big cowboy into king ranch appeared to be flowing approximately 9 m over the nomination day per a conversation i had with fred boas today i discovered that two wells with zero noms flowed a considerable volume they are as follows rocher big cowboy 27002 42 000 approx big cowboy 2 27003 84 000 approx total flow 126 000 mm s more or less i think that this may be part of the production increase which we are trying to account for in addition to the acock production at the briscoe well which came on in august please let me know what you think i would like to make sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and our economics thank you mary

save cash why hesitate getting the best value by getting the exact same equipment with original manufacturers warranty at a much lower price q what is considered factory refurbished a there are lots of things that can label items factory refurbished some are so frivolous its laughable but because consumer laws prevent manufacturers from selling anything considered factory refurbished as new the second consumer gets the best deal here are a few examples manufacturers distributors are not allowed to export outside their territory country to avoid disturbing the dealer reseller channel in different countries manufacturers and distributors cannot export the product as new and therefore label it as refurb most major retail superstores offer a 30 day money back guarantee on their products and there are those consumers that just simply take advantage of that these items are returned to the manufacturer inspected and repackaged like new items where the box or casing was damaged in shipment which are returned to the manufacturer the item was returned to the manufacturer because of a slight defect the part that was defective was replaced by the manufacturer tested and then repackaged just like new the item was returned because of a minor cosmetic blemish on the casing that was corrected demonstration units are also considered factory refurbished these units are inspected tested and repackaged the box was simply opened thats it brand new overstocked items are also labeled factory refurbished all factory refurbished products are inspected serviced by the manufacturer then tested and repackaged to meet original product specifications all merchandise is warranted by the original manufacturer your one stop distributorjebel ali duty free zonedubai uae www

but it s in the mid sized explorers and deveiopers like montana oi mogi that the biggest gains are being made in the last 12 months many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple returns breaking news april 29 montana oil and gas reports the following update on its sylvan lake project after several delays due to unseasonable weather and road closures in the province of alberta the contracted drilling rig was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the 5 3 38 3 w 5 m well the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well immediately there after the company s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion of tie in upon lifting of the road ban with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and gas has prepared a detailed project description project history the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late 1950 s and has produced over 40 million barrels mbbls of high quality crude oil and 50 billion cubic feet bcf of associated natural gas predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations the field remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics the original freehold lease on section 3 38 3 w 5 m was leased to a major oil company as was most of the sylvan lake field itself an exploratory well was drilled by this major company in 7 3 38 3 w 5 m in 1958 and was abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely eroded by post depositional cutting as a consequence the major company did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the deeper mineral rights below the base of the jurassic formations on the west one half of section 3 back to the freehold mineral rights owner in the early 1960 s this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more specifically not often by the major companies accordingly these mineral rights sat available and dormant until the early 2000 s as almost all oil and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee through diligent land work including field visits our partners discovered this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section 3 since that time our partners have managed to lease an additional 160 acres one quarter section of section 3 energy 51 has the right to earn 50 of this prospect possibly 75 with the drilling of a test well in 5 3 38 3 w 5 m land discussion our partners have secured a 100 working interest in the west half and northeast quarter of section 3 38 3 w 5 m the land comprises some 480 acres one section or one square mile equals 640 acres primary drilling spacing in alberta is as follows one quarter section spacing 160 acres for oil and one section spacing 640 acres for natural gas the province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units called holdings should you be able to prove to the province s satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased well density almost the entire sylvan lake field pekisko pool has been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering pekisko oil we will down space as well geological discussion pekisko formation the principle target of this prospect is oil and associated gas production from the deeper older pekisko formation the sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the pekisko formation this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions overlying this ancient shoreline are cap rocks impermeable layers of the mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous jurassic impermeable shales these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and account for billions of barrels of reserves production facilities discussion this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas over the past forty five years accordingly a multitude of gas gathering and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been constructed a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed drilling location the capacity of the processing facility is approximately 70 mmcf d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf d accordingly excess capacity of 24 mmcf d exists in the facility which would be in the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of red deer alberta accordingly trucking costs would be minimal to get oil product to the transportation system for more detailed project description please see news release dated fri apr 29 good luck and successfu trading conclusion the examples above show the awesome earning potential of little known companies that explode onto investor s radar screens many of you are already familiar with this is mogi poised and positioned to do that for you then you may feel the time has come to act and please watch this one trade

efforts to move offshore and overseas in search of the larger reserves considerable oil and gas in proven fields remain to be exploited by well managed independent oil companies capable of extracting these reserves at lower risk and lower cost than unproved prospects bnp petroleum s initial development strategy has been to acquire such proven fields and increase production through the application

voip technologies shares outstanding 34 oo 0 ooo float 4 00 o ooo current price o 08 will it continue higher watch this one monday as we know many of you like momentum breaking news may 25 20 o 5 v nomad international inc ndin announced today it has entered into a letter of intent to provide an exclusive license to its voip products with lmb technologies inc for the caribbean market which

market commercially in the short term stated jan olivier ceo and chairman of nomad international inc may 18 nomad international inc ndin commented today on the recent announcement by the canadian radio television and telecommunications commission crtc that they would regulate voice over internet protocol voip service only when it is provided and used as local telephone service in its decision the crtc determined that in an effort to build sustainable competition in local telephone markets the incumbent carriers will not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to stifle competition the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter the canadian market with our products via internet service providers cable companies and virtual operators the ruling permits us to enter the market with a competitive framework stated jan oliver ceo of nomad international inc the key to nomad s entry into the voip market is the ability of its products to offer services to both broadband and dial up customers though broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization worldwide dial up remains the primary source of internet connectivity in the u s alone there are over 20 o ooo 0 oo users of the internet of the total users in the u s the total number of users of broadband is only approximately 40 oo 0 000 stats by the yankee group dial up therefore represents approximately 8 o of the entire internet connectivity market the percentage of dial up versus broadband users worldwide is even higher nomad s ability to offer voip products to dial up customers and service providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace by offering a unique proprietary and easily adaptable product about nomad international inc nomad international inc is a multi national internet communications company developing cost effective telecommunications through voice over internet protocol voip technologies the company s revolutionary voip product line called nomad systems that has dial up broadband dsl cable satellite and wireless capabilities the company
