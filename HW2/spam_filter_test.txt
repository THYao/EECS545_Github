491	Subject california energy crisis california s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues what happened in california the source of california s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand california s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent at the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added the result predictably is a shortage this summer peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state in addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis first the state s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility in california state regulation prevented this strategy this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price second retail markets were not deregulated regulated retail rates remained in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate they are now nearly bankrupt in short california s problems were caused by regulation not deregulation regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices at the time california was developing its restructuring plan enron warned the state s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives which if adopted would have averted the current crisis enron s role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem power sellers including enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media here are the facts other than a small amount of wind power enron is not a generator in the state of california every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers as a seller to end use markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face we protected and still protect our customers from price volatility you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market early reports mischaracterized this as a enron continues to sign up customers in the state and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets enron s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs there has never been more demand for our products and services the solution the solution to california s crisis is also straightforward in summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state s utilities increasing supply california s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year in california it often takes 5 to 7 years california simply must streamline this process ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit 40 times as much nox california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is an open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today california should fully open its retail market reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixed price basis the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk restoring the financial integrity of the state s institutions the utilities in california are not paying their bills this has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse price caps have been proposed they don t work have never worked and they will not work here price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california there is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education roads and other public goods which the private sector cannot do as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media it s important for you to know this we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

544	Subject re meter 5892 daren sorry it has taken so long to get back to this issue i am with ees now karen lindley allocates this point but i feel the need to help her because this issue came to light while i was in transition exxon allocates this point and we receive a allocation statement from them on a monthly basis december 2000 the total flow at the meter was 646 mmbtu i copied esther garcia on this e mail so that she can look into the possibility that there is a measurement error esther will need to respond to karen on the matter of the possible measurement error furthermore it seems odd to me that scheduling had 8 928 mmbtu confirmed at this point and only 646 mmbtu flowed i would ask mark where he got his confirmed volumes from as a temporary fix i reallocated the meter and gave the total flow to alpine resources they will be short paid in their minds until ester and karen can get the possible measurement error issue resolved i would also suggest that mark and karen get together to review the scheduling of this point so that karen can call exxon to reconcile their allocation with what we have the additional alpine deal at this point charlene can redraft her invoice on monday 2 26 01 that will show the 646 mmbtu going to alpine january 2001 again scheduling has 9 193 confirmed at this meter when on 3 241 mmbtu flowed i temporarily reallocated the meter so that the entire volume that flowed went to alpine they remain 10 mmbtu short paid but charlene can redraft her invoice and pay them something until mark validity of other deals at this point and karen exxon s allocation of this point can get this issue resolved there is also the issue with the exxon transport at this point that was scheduled at 1 500 mmbtu per month for the months in question this transport affects the allocation at the king ranch tailgate on the exxon 024 contract i copied howard camp who will be training the contractor that will take my place in volume management so that he can stay on top of the resolution of this issue fred daren j farmer ect 02 23 2001 03 30 pm to fred boas hou ees ees cc subject re meter 5892 fred why is nothing being allocated to alpine this is a good deal we have in place with them and i really need the problem resolved d forwarded by daren j farmer hou ect on 02 23 2001 03 27 pm charlene richmond 02 23 2001 02 36 pm to daren j farmer hou ect ect cc vance l taylor hou ect ect donald p reinhardt hou ect ect melissa k ratnala hou ect ect melissa graves hou ect ect fred boas hou ees ees subject re meter 5892 i need help john childres with alpine is getting made and wants to be paid i have nothing to pay him he is looking for payment of dec 2000 and jan 2001 john needs to pay his royalty owners would someone please help me get this matter resolved charlene richmond 02 21 2001 05 38 pm to daren j farmer hou ect ect cc subject re meter 5892 i spoke with karen lindley about volume not being allocated she said that she passed it on to fred boas daren j farmer 02 21 2001 04 46 pm to charlene richmond hou ect ect cc fred boas hou ees ees melissa graves hou ect ect karen lindley corp enron enron subject re meter 5892 i have done deals with john at this point why are we not being allocated any volume d charlene richmond 02 21 2001 02 59 pm to fred boas hou ees ees daren j farmer hou ect ect melissa graves hou ect ect cc karen lindley corp enron enron subject meter 5892 i am getting several phone calls from alpine resources demanding to be paid for meter 5892 and there is nothing there to be paid the person name doing the requesting is john childers and he said that he spoke to daren farmer he is looking for 859 mmbtu s for december 2000 and 3 251 mmbtu s for january 2001 this is on the katy gas unit if anyone would like to talk to john his phone number is 281 646 0232 charlene x 31539

business development company abdv seeks out companies that show promise and are in need of raising capital and require accounting and managerial assistance it is the intention of abdv to build a

primezone via comtex the following is a letter from john figliolini president of atlantis business development corporation inc otcbb ldgkcpf dear shareholder addlrko i am writing to you today to discuss the new direction which your company will be heading up until this point we made it clear that abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of the market our basic premise was to seek out companies that can be turned into positive cash flow businesses with the proper equity investment made into them by abdv fine wein records is an example of that with a financial commitment of 250 000 by abdv we expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant positive cash flow over the next 12 months from the various projects they are currently working on e direct is another example we should start to see some meaningful positive cash flow developing and continuing over the next 12 months however abdv has not maintained a particular industry focus as of today that has changed wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir last week we announced that abdv will be providing 1 000 000 in equity financing to future quest inc pink sheets a company in the oil gas sector this was the start of our new direction abdv will be dedicated in locating and provide managerial accounting and financing for companies in the energy field from oil and gas companies to alternative energy companies jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft you may ask why the energy related field simply it currently offers many opportunities and with the price of oil approaching 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth to be made in this sector according to adjusted inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak of 73 from the 1970 s however unlike the oil crisis of the past we are looking at what will be a problem to stay with us for a long time simply put the demand for oil world wide has increased by some 2 5 this year alone most of which is because of china the increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the bubble bursts will result in oil back in the 20 30 level we are looking at a trend that is now cemented in stone there are more players in the world economy today that require oil gas to propel their own economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at these higher levels abdv has already aligned itself with individuals that have experience in the energy field these individuals will help locate viable opportunities and the funding necessary to participate in these opportunities wtxrxayfisoira so what do we do with our non energy related businesses such as fine wein records and e direct well first of all we will continue to incubate and nurture these businesses until they are at a level where they can move on their own i believe that both of these companies will be strong viable businesses in 12 months from now at that point i will recommend to abdv s board of directors that we spin off these two businesses to our shareholders this strategy is in keeping with the basic premise of our business module whereby we share the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing public our portfolio companies we can then continue to concentrate in the energy related field lvxhkmblmcewrw by concentrating on a specific sector such as the energy area we will be able to define abdv s purpose and guide it like a laser our goal will be to locate and make investments in no less than four energy related businesses over the next 12 months i believe that by maintaining this focus an investment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative way to participate in the booming oil gas and energy related fields twqssqlqqkvbdm fine wein records inc announces compilation music deal for theworld renowned i love ny logo fine wein records inc a subsidiary of

september lst this little giant closed at 06 on october 8 th up 500 in about 5 weeks do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon p as many of you may agree some not all of these stocks move in price because they are promoted making a very large number of investors aware of the stock the awareness is underway on dmxp pp let s look at the company delta mining and exploration corp otc dmxpp about the company p delta mining and exploration corp otc dmxp is a mineral exploration company that controls 6 properties totaling 7 554 acres approximately 11 sq miles in montana the properties are all located over what management considers to be some of the most prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states another 10 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are controlled in bolivia south america initial work has revealed that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those found in north america p the management team is led by chief executive officer dr barry rayment who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration company to the next level dr rayment brings 32 years of experience in the field of geology along with running some of the most successful mining companies in the industry dr rayment was the president of bema gold corp amex bgo a company with a market cap of close to a billion dollars he was also affiliated with glamis gold gold fields mining and amselco exploration bp minerals among others his vast experience in the mining sector along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company moves forward p among the support team is stephen kay a geologist with more than 30 years experience in exploration throughout europe south africa south america and the united states while with gold fields mining corp stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent drilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california p delta has experienced significant technical success since its start up in 1997 for example delta has discovered the first in situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead kimberlite southeast of lewistown the company also controls part of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator minerals a major step toward finding the presence of economic diamonds including pyrope garnet chromite and clinoprroxene p an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this under explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta canada p in bolivia delta controls approximately two thirds of a highly prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia group of concessions covering 7 860 acres 12 sq miles the other one third is presently being explored by de beers in addition to the independencia property delta controls more than 2 000 acres comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further exploration is justified p delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also by acquiring additional diamond properties delta will focus on identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and finance additional exploration p in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta controls they also control a gold property with great potential the property is near la paz in bolivia where initial analysis revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an extensive exploration program pp source company website p recent headlines go online and read the full stories p delta mining and exploration corp is invited to attend a conference with the bolivian chamber of commerce p delta mining and exploration corp visits homestead property in preparation of work program p delta mining and exploration corp discloses preliminary gold exploration findings in south america p delta mining and exploration corp looks to continue diamond exploration in south america

867	Subject re meter 984229 roos common point trade zone 18 vance per our conversation we have two possible options to resolve this deal depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not producing if that is the case the purchase from calpine and any contracts hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level once that is done i will need to research in the system how those wellheads were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal this will probably have to go back to hplc s ownership of hplr s gathering assets non producing should we determine that the common point and any wells behind it have been shut in or p a d we will need to reallocate this deal to zero and unwind any hedges against it or move the hedges to another deal if possible since the deal is older we probably sold lower priced contracts against the production and a buy back today would possibly result in a financial loss in either case the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow at meter 4229 which i am currently looking into i will email you as soon as i ascertain that date in lieu of the past couple of days we may need to look at all of the deals which were impacted by hplc s aquisition of hplr s gathering to ensure that they are being captured properly both at a book level and at a state filing level please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish this thank you again for all of your hard work in this area mary

t been used in gas production in lets say a year or so would this help performance this would also force the schedulers to path think about the way they are pathing their transactions and not rely on old paths that may no longer be accurate we ve seen old bad zero paths be re used accidentally on 2 the scheduling position window is the weakest link goodbye on 3 contract reference i know is used alot in the supply and market list nomlogic is also slated to use these contract reference fields for comments do we need it in the inventory list probably not as much as the supply and market list but i still believe it s necessary for pools and imbalance accounts on 4 we use this functionality alot on cgas tenn trco and sab when we path one to many or many to one in chunks it does seem to go faster than one path at a time on 5 brokered paths could really just be slammed in there no need for the extra processing that occurs for service contracts thanks original message from sullivan patti

thoughts original message from pena matt sent monday october 08 2001 4 26 pm to pinion richard jaquet tammy superty robert pena matt cc warner john ripley brian d souza romeo rao ramesh subject path manager rewrite optimization project importance high all we re currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed going foward i would like bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers schedulers we had this approach with nomlogic and having clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely who ever you choose we would need about 15 of their time for now later on with coordination efforts and testing it may go up to 75 i don t see that happening for a while though the sooner we get someone to devote to this the better off we will be i expect these changes that we ll be looking into should improve performance quite a bit that being said we ve identified three items that would speed up processing the retrieval of path manager 1 currently the path manager attempts to reuse path ids i can t think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn t find a match i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can t think of a valid reason for performing this work i talked with dave nommensen and according to him what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place from a scheduling perspective my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it if you were overpathed you d see it in the path manager either way pinion richard to restate the question for clarity in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply market and a service adds any up downstream contract information and or duns or drn override and then saves it unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted has this changed at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path activity number match for nominations texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected therefore if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify i don t think that this constant old path look up is needed kinsey lisa get rid of this 2 the scheduling position window does anyone use this if not we ll remove the code logic that populates this window i have never seen a scheduler use this please verify pinion richard originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system autonoms so it was duplicated in unify by request it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it s use the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers lose it kinsey lisa why is this still here 3 on the inventory pool list does anyone need to see the contarct references list again this code is called every retrieval time and doesn t appear to be used from my observations if they do need this information we could provide it but if not i d prefer to remove the functionality pinion richard this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool keep it kinsey lisa yes we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools 4 when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths what s the average number of paths they create at one time what about updates i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts by update i mean going to the path list and changing an upstream downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created pinion richard this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline there is no average they typically update a path with up downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however i hope this answers your question i see no change to this process at this time kinsey lisa on some pipes this function is used more than others when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible at this time i do not see a need to change this process 5 on brokered paths do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service in other words when updating brokered arrangements we don t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated why do we do this for service is it because we have to renominate it i assume that s what it s for since we don t send brokered paths to the pipe anyway with the nomlogic implmentation two way interface we were planning on having it behave the same way as service we need this verified pinion richard we don t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path i don t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time kinsey lisa agree with richard

1037	Subject texoma beaumont hpl maintenance this is in regard to the maintenance that you want to do at the texoma beaumont interconnect replace some valves i believe we had discussed doing this at a time when mobil beaumont refinery would have low gas takes that window of opportunity will be in early to mid february mobil will take down some of the units at different times during the month some of these units are endothermic some are exothermic so in some cases their gas load goes up when they take certain units down but based on the schedule of ups and downs that i ve been given it looks like their gas load will be at a low point between february 1 and february 12 at somewhere around 50 000 d last we talked about hpl continuing to deliver 20 000 d through the low pressure meter and delivering the rest through centana is this still the plan we met with mobil last year in july to talk to them about what we need to do that it would take less than a day and that during that time hpl would deliver some of our gas to them through the centana meter but that meeting was a long time ago and we might need to meet again you know how conservative one thing of concern in the past two months we have effected some of our midcon delivery obligation by delivering 30 000 d gas in kind to mobil beaumont so we will not be able to do this during the day that we do our maintenance once you gents let me know what you game plan is and confirm how we ll handle gas flows while we do our work i d like to be the one that initially tells mobil of our plans and set up the initial meeting it s going to take a lot of coordination because i can guarantee you that mobil s maintenance schedule will change lee 3 5923

1039	Subject proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all affiliates ngi s daily gas price index breaking news posted sep 26 4 16 pm proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all affiliates federal energy regulatory commissioners wednesday agreed to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking broadening the application of standards of conduct for transmission providers including both natural gas pipelines and power lines to require separation of the regulated monopolies from any other company affiliate previously the rules simply required creation of a firewall including separate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel between gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates the proposed rule would wall off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affiliate gas or electric including financial affiliates the commission was presented with two options regarding the application of the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates which still in many cases have bundled operations one option would enforce complete separation while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchases of bundled retail native load staff and commissioners wood william massey and nora brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personnel so they would not be privy to market information about transmission operations that other non affiliated competitors did not have access to commissioner linda breathitt however argued for exempting personnel dealing solely with retail native load breathitt said that while she supported the eventual separation of the entities she was concerned about the timing i see no compelling reason at this time there have been no complaints and no evidence she said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction i agree with concept philosophically but i think there will be other opportunities later on after we do a little more bridge building with state commissions wood said he understood the political issue here with respect to federal state relations but i think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems waivers could be granted staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel if i am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load i can go into the control room and get all the information i want one staffer responded wood proposed and the commissioners ratified a proposed rule with no exceptions but which makes clear that in the final rule the commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required commenting parties should provide cost benefit analysis on both sides of the question state commissions are also invited to comment wood had suggested the commission extend the separation to all sales employees but make it clear that if we don t hear from people that they really want this separation we ain t going to do it

1151	Subject enron announces plans to merge with dynegy today we announced plans to merge with dynegy a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you ve worked so hard to build following are the major components of the transaction deal terms the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0 2685 dynegy shares for every enron share for example each 1 000 shares of enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing chevrontexaco owns approximately 26 percent of dynegy s outstanding common stock chevrontexaco will invest 1 5 billion in dynegy immediately and an additional 1 billion in dynegy on closing of the merger dynegy will immediately invest 1 5 billion in cash in enron s northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year enron will have immediate access to dynegy s 1 5 billion cash investment in enron s northern natural gas subsidiary management of newly formed company chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company which will be called dynegy inc and steve bergstrom will be president and coo i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration the make up of the integration team has not yet been determined the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002 this merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers as with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible as i said in my video this is a day like no other in our company s history we considered several options but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at if you have additional questions please submit them to questions enron com we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions if you receive any calls from the media please refer them to our media team at 713 853 5670 i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company rather than closing doors we are opening new ones as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise including our market reach financial strength and industry experience together we will be a new merchant powerhouse and again thank you for everything you have done for enron investors and

1158	Subject new tax law update whether you re investing for your kids education or your retirement the new federal tax law may make your goals easier to reach the 1 35 trillion tax relief package could affect your finances in many areas from investing for college and retirement to managing income and estate taxes many of the tax cuts will phase in gradually over the next several years but to help you take advantage of all possible provisions we should start planning soon some of the ways you may benefit include lower income tax rates the gradual reduction of tax rates has already begun in fact the new withholding schedule went into effect on july 1 and you should receive a tax rebate check soon due to the creation of a new 10 bottom rate retroactive to january 1 2001 as tax rates fall over the next few years your disposable income will likely rise offering an opportunity to invest more toward your various goals education funding incentives parents who want to help their children attend college may now find their financial task easier the tax relief act will improve education savings tools such as education iras the accounts contribution limit will rise from 500 to 2 000 in 2002 what s more money in these accounts can now be used for elementary and secondary school costs in addition to higher education expenses state sponsored 529 college savings plans also beginning in 2002 distributions from these plans for qualified education expenses will be tax free currently earnings in the accounts are deferred and taxed at the beneficiary s rate upon withdrawal 529 s are particularly attractive due to their generous contribution limits deductions for education expenses the act increases eligibility for student loan interest deductions and it creates a new deduction for higher education expenses the child tax credit though not tied specifically to education expenses this credit will provide increasing help to parents investing for college previously 500 per qualifying child under 17 the credit increases to 600 in 2001 2004 700 in 2005 2008 800 in 2009 and 1 000 in 2010 and thereafter higher retirement plan contribution limits the tax act will allow people with earned income to invest more in retirement plans and iras possibly helping them retire sooner and more comfortably your options may include traditional and roth iras annual contribution limits for both of these types of iras will gradually rise from 2 000 this year to 5 000 in 2008 after that the limits will be indexed to inflation in 500 increments 401 k s and 403 b s working individuals also may be able to invest more in their employer retirement plan the limit on elective deferrals will gradually rise from 10 500 this year to 15 000 in 2006 and this doesn t include the catch up contribution provision for people 50 years and older and much more there are other provisions in the new tax law that may benefit you and your family when we meet we ll identify the ones that apply to you and help you make the most of them as you can see the new tax law provides meaningful tax savings in a number of areas but because the changes will be phased in gradually and some are set to expire after 2010 without reauthorization your planning must be flexible enough to react to year by year changes such planning is where american express financial advisors excels i m backed by a corporate team of specialists in taxation investments estate and retirement planning and more to help you make the most of your finances let me know if you have any questions i look forward to seeing you byron make all you can save all you can give all you can john wesley byron w ellis cfp tm clu chfc senior financial advisor american express financial advisors ids life insurance company 1450 lake robbins drive suite 100 the woodlands tx 77380 phone 281 367 8658 ext 2227 fax 281 364 9628 e mail byronellis usa net winmail dat

back in october can t this be fixed in the actualization process the numbers for october between ena tetco and hpl vary a good bit are we your only customer at that point and why do we show volumes on days ena had no transactions with hpl can we simply put zero paths in unify and extend our existing deals in sitara with zero volumes and have you guys actualize these small volumes to handle this we go round and round at this point changing volumes two three or more times call me if you have questions thanks victor forwarded by victor lamadrid hou ect on 12 14 2000 08 50 am from meredith mitchell on 12 14 2000 09 28 am to victor lamadrid hou ect ect cc subject re hpl discrepancy victor the sitara ticket that we were using for the month of october is 421415 tetco shows that the volumes that hpl was allocated on october 6 th and october 19 th were 9 dths and 44 dths respectively those volumes were pulled off of our backhaul contract because there was no nomination in place this is the same problem that we have had over and over with them also we just found out on tuesday that the oba did not go into effect until december 1 2000 we were originally told that they were putting the oba in effect retroactively to november of 1999 in fact i thought that hpl had made a lot of retroactive changes in the system to adjust for the oba do you remember that hpl told us that ray calles at tetco is the one who decided that the oba would not be effective until december of 2000 nobody even informed us of this change i stumbled upon it when researching a november issue for alfonso trabulsi and brenda fletcher in addition to all of this i received another email which i will copy below asking me to go in for the month of october and adjust all of my estimated volumes in unify to match what hpl shows that we were allocated i had been going in all month long and matching to their numbers and we were clean for the deadline at the end of the month i ran the allocation report from tetco for the month of october and some of hpl s numbers were very different from tetco s including the two days that i mentioned above i sent jackie young an email back showing her tetco s numbers and i haven t received a response i will copy that email below as well just to catch you up on what s been going on jackie young 12 12 2000 10 01 am to cynthia franklin corp enron enron meredith mitchell hou ect

that enron was allocated for the month of october and some of the volumes are very different from the volumes that you show i copied your numbers below and copied tetco s volumes below that with the disrepancies in red i was wondering if you could double check the 3 rd 4 th 11 th 12 th 25 th and 27 th to see if you had purchases on those days from a counterparty other than enron north america at that meter it looks like maybe the volumes that you show are the total flow at that meter but i think that only part of the gas was actually allocated to us i don t mind putting the allocated volumes in path manager but i d like to make sure that on the above days i am only putting in the amount that enron was allocated also on the 6 th and the 19 th tetco shows exactly half of what you show which i thought was kind of strange i am going to have to get tetco s permission to do a retroactive nomination for those two days at the volumes you have requested before i can put anything in sitara or unify my manager is out of the office and will be back tomorrow but i would like for him to double check the deal that we will have to create in sitara for those two days since we are dealing with a

1345	Subject cleco deals 449243 397957 state tract 121 meter 785 fred or anita i just wanted to recap our discussion to be sure that we are all on the same page from my understanding the allocation for meter 785 state tract 121 is supplied from bryancy braumley prior to 09 1 00 bryancy would calculate flow from certain wellheads total this volume and then send us an allocation that would show how much gas was allocated to texas general land and hpl sale from cleco at meter 785 effective 09 1 00 a compressor was put in and the gas from 785 now flows through this compressor as well as the gas from meter 9662 deal 137595 sales from dewbre and is now measured at meter 3527 tivoli station for bryancy s allocation she must take the meter statement from meter 3527 and deduct meter 9662 s flow once this is done she can take that net number and do an allocation between texas general land and hpl cleco like she has done previously i believe meter 785 is now a check meter and meter 3527 is the actual pay meter for 9 00 there were two deals in place for the sale from cleco deal 397957 and 449243 per discussions with daren farmer danny conner and jennifer martinez i have been instructed to zero out the deal for 397957 and use 449243 as the correct deal number therefore fred boas and i have zeroed out the 397957 deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal 449243 deal 397957 was priced at ship less 18 which was incorrect and deal 449243 is priced at ship less 15 therefore an adjustment will generate for 9 00 for the difference in price and the change in location the allocated volume for cleco did not change however i am not sure that bryancy is allocating the volume properly between texas general land and hpl cleco i have spoke to her as well as jennifer martinez and curtis funderbruk with cleco so there might be some pma s for volume differences in addition i have changed the allocation method at meter 3527 to be a callout swing effect 9 00 for october and succeeding months the volume should be computed by taking meter 3527 deducting out meter 9662 then byancy should take this net number and split it between texas general land and hpl cleco the texas general land nom is currently at meter 785 and the hpl cleco deal is at meter 3527 fred mentioned that the texas general land nom might need to be moved to meter 3527 but nothing has been decided on that yet please let me know if something i have stated is not your understanding or you need something more done on my end also let me know who is going to be doing this monthly allocation it might be beneficial to have one person doing all the points meters 3527 9662 785 thanks for your help

1422	Subject market watch undervalued report f april 2004 top pick of the month life energy and technology holdings inc otcbb leth leth receives 250 000 000 in financing to fund the manufacture of the environmentally friendly biosphere process system waste to energy units in the united states first unit to roll out in new orleans in early second quarter we are expecting earth shattering upcoming news leading a strong rally in leth for a company that has announced over 100 million in sales orders in the past year and tops that record setting achievement by acquiring the equivalent of 8 62 per share in cash for major worldwide expansion our readers grabbed substantial profits for our march pick ushg featured at 75 reached 3 65 in 8 days traded as high as 7 00 since the biosphere process system soaring worldwide demand leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste problem this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste agricultural wastes forestry wastes medical wastes industrial wastes sewage sludge shale oil sour natural gas and the huge market of used tires leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid the biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide need for cost effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal of waste leth has secured worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while a major push for generating electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot topic due to shortages and massive power failures financing of 250 million positions leth for astronomical sales the magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the fact that this 1 50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent to 8 62 per common share in cash there are 26 biosphere process systems presently in operation worldwide the available funding could easily be used to produce 100 additional biospheres now factor in that the average sale price is 7 million per biosphere we cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for with a potential 700 000 000 in future sales with 29 million shares outstanding leth stock guidance current price 1 80 near term target 4 80 projected high for 04 12 50 leth s blue chip partner fortifying the system leth is an alliance partner with tetra tech inc nasdaq ttek 21 a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental mechanical and electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government with annual sales of 800 million tetra tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits installation and continuous worldwide monitoring of the biosphere process system for leth tetra tech is now in the process of obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the biosphere process in the state of louisiana this is a monumental event for leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana while having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near term announcement political power fosters rapid global expansion leth has captured the profit making attention of both us and international investors by embracing a major foothold on the global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate electricity from alternative sources this has been accomplished by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the globe through the political contacts at the highest level from dr albert reynolds chairman of leth who is also the former prime minister of ireland dr reynolds international stature has been instrumental in guiding leth into a position of worldwide dominance in an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market uncommon value for a company of this caliber we are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the biosphere the impressive backlog of over 100 million in sales orders and the company s very solid financial position we view this perfectly timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the company s own sales records as our top stock pick for april we anticipate the continuation of strong positive developments that will ignite leth shares which carry our highest rating for short term trading profits followed by robust long term capital gains top pick of the month cautions that small and micro cap stocks are

i needed to read this in light of yesterday s events tribute to the united states this from a canadian newspaper is worth sharing america the good neighbor widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from toronto by gordon sinclair a canadian television commentator what follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as printed in the congressional record this canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the americans as the most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth germany japan and to a lesser extent britain and italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts none of these countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the united states when france was in danger of collapsing in 1956 it was the americans who propped it up and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of paris i was there i saw it when earthquakes hit distant cities it is the united states that hurries in to help this spring 59 american communities were flattened by tornadoes nobody helped the marshall plan and the truman policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged countries now newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent warmongering americans i d like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the united states dollar build its own airplane does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the boeing jumbo jet the lockheed tri star or the douglas dcl 0 if so why don t they fly them why do all the international lines except russia fly american planes why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon you talk about japanese technocracy and you get radios you talk about german technocracy and you get automobiles you talk about american technocracy and you find men on the moon not once but several times and safely home again you talk about scandals and the americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at even their draft dodgers are not pursued and hounded they are here on our streets and most of them unless they are breaking canadian laws are getting american dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here when the railways of france germany and india were breaking down through age it was the americans who rebuilt them when the pennsylvania railroad and the new york central went broke nobody loaned them an old caboose both are still broke i can name you 5000 times when the americans raced to the help of other people in trouble can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the americans in trouble i don t think there was outside help even during the san francisco earthquake our neighbors have faced it alone and i m one canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around they will come out of this thing with their flag high and when they do they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles i hope canada is not one of those stand proud america wear it proudly this is one of the best editorials that i have ever read regarding the united states it is nice that one man realizes it i only wish that the rest of the world would realize it we are always blamed for everything and never even get a thank you for the things we do i would hope that each of you would send this to as many people as you can and emphasize that they should send it to as many of their friends until

1686	Subject fw gop action plan what you can do original message from alex fagen mailto alex fagens net sent wednesday november 15 2000 9 56 pm to undisclosed recipient rad 3 1 stup com subject fw gop action plan what you can do original message from kenneth r pybus to sent wednesday november 15 2000 9 28 am subject fwd gop action plan what you can do i got this from paul sperry at worldnetdaily i don t know who joe morris is but this sounds like a plan note that this has been circulating since last thursday united republican fund of illinois chicago november 9 2000 from joseph a morris president to urf leaders and friends herewith is some practical advice on action that every citizen can take in the event that the florida recount confirms the election of george bush but al gore fails to concede we all know what is going on in florida and that the election hinges on the outcome i am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will have to do if what i think is going to happen actually does the recount which will be finished by 5 p m thursday will likely show bush to be the winner once again with only a few thousand overseas ballots to be counted those ballots will be overwhelmingly for bush a minimum of 60 and probably closer to 75 if the count goes our way tomorrow we have won this election this is when something critical happens either gore bows out gracefully or he doesn t and i can almost guarantee he won t these are people wedded to power who will only go down kicking and screaming they will use every legal maneuver in the book to steal the election in 1960 when richard nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election results he didn t for the sake of the country expect no such noble behavior this time what will they try one bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the florida results on a flimsy premise they are already floating this as a trial balloon in the form of the allegedly confusing ballots in palm beach county i have seen the ballots they are not confusing in the least indeed they are identical in form to the punch card ballots used in chicago and cook county illinois in this very election what is more it is just as likely that palm beach county voters who wanted to vote for bush inadvertently voted for nader all parties approved the form of ballot before the election the form of ballot issue is a mere pretext for an effort a judicial invalidation of the florida election while i hope this scenario doesn t come to pass i fear that it will and it will only have disastrous results for the country the election fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court if this comes to pass the vision of our founders and the blood of patriots will have been betrayed personally i am not going to stand for this and i hope you won t either the good news is that we are not without voice here is what must be done if the vote count affirms bush s election we allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the gore camp if they have not graciously conceded after a few hours we must bombard the news media and our public officials at every level with phone calls of outrage that demand gore s concession i mean literally millions of phone calls we must jam their phone banks with calls there are millions of us so it shouldn t be too difficult while you re at it send e mails to your local newspapers as well if it becomes widely reported and it will that there is a groundswell demanding that gore back down and not embarrass the country it will be very difficult for

1794	Subject california energy crisis california s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues what happened in california the source of california s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand california s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent at the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added the result predictably is a shortage this summer peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state in addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis first the state s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility in california state regulation prevented this strategy this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price second retail markets were not deregulated regulated retail rates remained in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate they are now nearly bankrupt in short california s problems were caused by regulation not deregulation regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices at the time california was developing its restructuring plan enron warned the state s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives which if adopted would have averted the current crisis enron s role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem power sellers including enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media here are the facts other than a small amount of wind power enron is not a generator in the state of california every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers as a seller to end use markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face we protected and still protect our customers from price volatility you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities here are the facts as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities this decision reduced ees s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates ees did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy related products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times enron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis enron continues to sign up customers in the state and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets enron s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs there has never been more demand for our products and services the solution the solution to california s crisis is also straightforward in summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state s utilities increasing supply california s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year in california it often takes 5 to 7 years california simply must streamline this process ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit 40 times as much nox california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is an open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today california should fully open its retail market reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixed price basis the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk restoring the financial integrity of the state s institutions the utilities in california are not paying their bills this has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse price caps have been proposed they don t work have never worked and they will not work here price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california there is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education roads and other public goods which the private sector cannot do as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the

1808	Subject northern natural gas yesterday enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron s right to repurchase until june 30 we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy while we would like to keep northern natural we still have some 9 000 miles of safe profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our 10 billion damage claim against dynegy it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services ken dear ets colleague on thursday enron entered into a settlement over dynegy s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy in this respect enron corp has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas consequently enron corp has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved the company has concluded that with this settlement enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court for the northern natural gas employees i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day to day satisfaction of running a valuable successful business beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas over many years we have run high quality cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets keep up the good work stan

2099	Subject organizational changes we are making a number of significant organizational changes these changes are intended to accomplish four key objectives first we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position second we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships particularly with joe sutton s departure the ability to directly manage the day to day activities of 15 independent business units has become increasingly difficult third we need to accomplish these changes without in any way compromising the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower yielding asset positions and fourth as always we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities enron wholesale services today we are forming enron wholesale services ews which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses the closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following 1 enhanced communication and coordination across business units 2 more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities 3 more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business and 4 more rapid extension of enron s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and markets enron wholesale services will include our current north american european including japan and australia global markets and industrial markets operations and will be expanded to include enron s net works business unit as well as a new unit enron global assets in addition enron s merchant businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below mark frevert currently chairman of each of our wholesale units will assume the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services greg whalley currently chairman and ceo of enron net works will join mark in the office of the chairman as president and chief operating officer providing further impetus for these organizational changes several of our international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership positions rebecca mcdonald currently ceo of enron apachi will join ews as president and ceo of enron global assets enron global assets will have responsibility for managing all of enron s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north america and europe joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo will be jim hughes currently coo of enron apachi rebecca and jim will report to the ews office of the chairman sanjay bhatnagar currently ceo of enron india has joined ebs as ceo for the middle east and asia region sanjay will be responsible for building our broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region will report to sanjay in this role sanjay will report to the ebs office of the chairman in addition sanjay will continue to remain responsible

diomedes will report to the ebs office of the chairman jim bannantine currently co ceo of enron south america will be joining ees to lead ees commercial efforts outside north america and europe in order to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to facilitate our asset sales activities jim will remain in south america for at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south america throughout the transition jim will report to cliff baxter and to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services following the transition jim will join ees in addition to these changes in our international asset operations activities we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale businesses and the commercial support functions enron net

weather insurance equities interest rates foreign exchange and agricultural products enron industrial markets enron industrial markets organization under the leadership of jeff mcmahon president ceo and ray bowen chief operating officer remains unchanged commercial support for ews the commercial support functions for ews will remain with and be managed by the individual business units we are creating no incremental overhead in the creation of ews and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units these newly defined roles are as follows mid and back office operations sally beck will lead mid and back office operations across ews these services will become part of enron net works with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey executive vice president and chief

brian d souza romeo rao ramesh kinsey lisa lamadrid victor sullivan mary sullivan patti heal kevin staab theresa farmer daren j jaquet tammy superty robert bussell l kathryn subject re path manager rewrite optimization project following are my comments the managers cc d might have some additional thoughts original message from pena matt sent monday october 08 2001 4 26 pm to pinion richard jaquet tammy superty robert pena matt cc warner john ripley brian d souza romeo rao ramesh subject path manager rewrite optimization project importance high all we re currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed going foward i would like bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers schedulers we had this approach with nomlogic and having clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely who ever you choose we would need about 15 of their time for now later on with coordination efforts and testing it may go up to 75 i don t see that happening for a while though the sooner we get someone to devote to this the better off we will be i expect these changes that we ll be looking into should improve performance quite a bit that being said we ve identified three items that would speed up processing the retrieval of path manager 1 currently the path manager attempts to reuse path ids i can t think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn t find a match i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can t think of a valid reason for performing this work i talked with dave nommensen and according to him what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place from a scheduling perspective my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it if you were overpathed you d see it in the path manager either way pinion richard to restate the question for clarity in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply market and a service adds any up downstream contract information and or duns or drn override and then saves it unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted has this changed at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path activity number match for nominations texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected therefore if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify i don t think that this constant old path look up is needed kinsey lisa get rid of this 2 the scheduling position window does anyone use this if not we ll remove the code logic that populates this window i have never seen a scheduler use this please verify pinion richard originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system autonoms so it was duplicated in unify by request it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it s use the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers lose it kinsey lisa why is this still here 3 on the inventory pool list does anyone need to see the contarct references list again this code is called every retrieval time and doesn t appear to be used from my observations if they do need this information we could provide it but if not i d prefer to remove the functionality pinion richard this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool keep it kinsey lisa yes we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools 4 when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths what s the average number of paths they create at one time what about updates i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts by update i mean going to the path list and changing an upstream downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created pinion richard this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline there is no average they typically update a path with up downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however i hope this answers your question i see no change to this process at this time kinsey lisa on some pipes this function is used more than others when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible at this time i do not see a need to change this process 5 on brokered paths do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service in other words when updating brokered arrangements we don t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated why do we do this for service is it because we have to renominate it i assume that s what it s for since we don t send brokered paths to the pipe anyway with the nomlogic implmentation two way interface we were planning on having it behave the same way as service we need this verified pinion richard we don t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path i don t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time kinsey lisa agree with richard

our next hot pick which we feel is the most undervalued stock we have ever featured and should outperform all other picks this year based on their sales figures incl a backlog of over 100 million incredibly solid numbers and low outstanding share total life energy and technology holdings inc otcbb leth current price 2 45 near term target 7 00 projected high for 04 15 00 we are sending this urgent investor bulletin revealing the most undervalued stock on the otcbb to our millions of subscribers for substantial profits immediately sales orders received by leth exceed 150 million over the past year while major news was just released that adds multi millions to the bottom line leth has experienced a recent spike in price and volume indicating heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials into electrical energy an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market mar 9 04 urgent news update leth announces the sale of two 2 biosphere process systems to procura international limited for 14 million with an option for the sale of an additional 98 systems over the next 24 months solving a dual crisis waste and energy leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste problem this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste agricultural wastes forestry wastes medical wastes industrial wastes sewage sludge shale oil sour natural gas and the huge market of used tires leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid mar 3 04 leth release major product delivery and net profit news leth delivered 12 biosphere process systems which resulted in a net profit of 3 5 million the equivalent of 12 cents per share leth is scheduled to receive an additional 7 million translating into an additional 24 cents per share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 months the net profit per share from just this single contract would value the stock above 6 by calculating the 36 cents per share total at an average industry pe of 18 22 examining leth by the numbers total assets 36 8 million 1 26 per share of assets cash 23 4 million 80 cents per share of cash shares outstanding 29 million down from 31 8 million after 2 8 million shares retired in feb 04 additional shares to

20 additional biosphere process systems have been ordered which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding over 100 million in upcoming sales many of these contractual agreements include options for the purchase of additional biosphere systems in the future once the initial order has been completed the options vary from hundreds to thousands of units which would send shockwaves through this low float emerging industry leader at an average sale price of 7 million per biosphere process system leth s blue chip partner fortifying the system leth is an alliance partner with tetra tech inc nasdaq ttek 20 a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental mechanical and electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government with annual sales of 800 million tetra tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits installation and continuous worldwide monitoring of the biosphere process system for leth tetra tech is now in the process of obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the biosphere process in the state of louisiana this is a monumental event for leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana while having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near term announcement stock set to explode on earnings boom leth has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to achieve record setting stock price levels in support of the company s breakout year the added kicker is that leth has historically released batches of very significant news announcements regarding successfully completed sales contracts early in the calendar year we feel that pattern is repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some very big surprises still to come there aren t any companies at any price level with the technology or exponential sales growth to match leth while simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major profits as global demand

2344	Subject fw classic thoughts on texas a m fox sports show host jim rome 1 they won t shut up they have to go on about spirit and old army and red ass and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in their urine to beat ut and blah blah blah shut up you start to get the feeling the entire school was built to spite ut 2 forget the fact that when the texas legislature back in the 1870 s passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a subsidiary branch of the main school university of texas that would teach agriculture and mechanics aggies love to say their school is older from where they get that i don t now the fact is the state intended a m to be a branch of ut they are like the afterbirth fromthe original creation like danny devito in twins 3 so they apparently have this complex so much so that they must devote their entire school to trying to prove to ut that they are just as good all the while nobody at ut denies that a m is a good school yet they won t shut up so they write a fight song about texas and how they want to beat them they have a fish camp for freshman where they tell them how bad texas is and how good a m and all its traditions are it is the world s largest known case of penis envy and it is manifested in everything a m does 4 the people at a m now we all have friends who went to a m or are at a m there are some nice people there however there is the corp east texas answer to dreams of rotc kids everywhere for every boy scout who never learned to stop playing with his gi joe toys there is the corp now forget the fact that a however nobody respects the corp i imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of the military world just because you dress like the army and try and act like the army does not make you the army people at a m don t even respect these clowns it is not cool to shave your head and dress up halloween is only supposed to be one day of the year if you want to carry guns and beat up civilians move to israel 5 it is even less cool to slobber on somebody s daughter on national television and call it a tradition dry humping 18 year old girls in the stands at football games is not cool not only is it not cool it should be against the law i know that in college station students are just prone to mount each other on the campus lawn or in the middle of class or anytime anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and start sucking on her face but everywhere else in the world it is looked down upon especially if you are doing it on my tv that is why we have moved the game from thanksgiving because people across the nation were gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co ed during somebody s thanksgiving dinner we do not need to see burly women engaged in a suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the clinique counter screw that forget make up it is too late for that just give them a veil 6 t u is not funny it is not insulting it is dumb just imagine if folks from texas kept talking about m a and giggling that would not be funny in fact it would be retarded that s why ut fans don t do it please learn 7 you want to lose the image of country bumpkins of a people fond of sheep of people that aren t stupid then quit building things that fall down quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national tv quit whooping in church quit whooping period quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoyment of dead mammals quit spending your friday nights practicing how to yell quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you re running for governor when you are filling out season ticket renewals and the form asks for your phone h w quit putting 258 3999 height 6 3 weight 185 just collectively stop making asses of yourselves go to east texas tour every small town and ask every red neck with a 5 th grade education why they cheer for a m and wear maroon that is your fan base this is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid 8 nobody cares if you think your band is better they might be louder they might march in neat little zig zags but they have no musical ability the point is nobody cares who wins halftime quit getting geeked up about marching bands i find it hard to believe you stood through your high school band s entire halftime performance and why cause nobody cared then and nobody cares now plus you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do care why is it cool all of a sudden now that you re in college 9 men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds perhaps the only justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an anal probe oh wait i understand now 10 dogs are not ladies they don t look or smell like ladies dogs eat their own feces and should be treated accordingly 11 finally college station is an arm pit of a town quit pretending that it is a great college town it is a town and there is a college there that should be the end of this comparison if you feel that life doesn t get any better than the dixie chicken and enjoy being stuck in a never ending dukes of hazard episode then move there more importantly don t move to austin they are trying to create an educated technological and open minded population base austin is and will continue to be the birthplace and final resting place of all that is cool as my friend stephen johnson once said if the world were ever to get an enema college station is where you would connect the hose if you go to school at a m please don t be an aggie god bless the great state of texas brian puls software engineer lockheed martin enterprise
